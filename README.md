My First HTML Website Project
    The goal of this project is to build a website with html basics. I am going to write out
    HTML boilerplat and build a website up with lists, bold, italics, headers, relative links, and
    aboslute links. I will also create multiple pages for my site and include embedded elements,
    such as images. I hope to dislpay a firm grasp of html basics in creating my website.
